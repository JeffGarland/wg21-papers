\section{Conclusion}

I believe it is worthwhile to investigate the \emph{Parallel Algorithms} optimization opportunities.
From what I can tell, there would not need to be any extra wording to allow variable vector width execution and load store reordering in such cases.
The ability to do these transformations follows naturally from letting the implementation choose the \code{datapar_abi}.
