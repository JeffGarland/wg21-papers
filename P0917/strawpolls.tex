Specific requests:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Discuss whether we still want \code{common_type} (also with multiple types) to derive its answer from user-defined conditional operators.
    For context, state the intent of \code{common_type}.
  \item Explore \code{= delete;} to go with defaulting.
\end{itemize}
