\section{Straw Polls}
\subsection{SG1 at Kona 2022}
\wgPoll{After significant experience with the TS, we recommend that the next
version (the TS version with improvements) of \code{std::simd} target the IS (\CC{}26)}
{10&8&0&0&0}

\wgUnanimous{We like all of the recommended changes to \code{std::simd} proposed in p1928r1
(Includes making all of \code{std::simd} \code{constexpr}, and dropping an ABI stable type)}

\wgPoll{Future papers and future revisions of existing papers that target
\code{std::simd} should go directly to LEWG.
(We do not believe there are SG1 issues with \code{std::simd} today.)}
