\begin{wgTitlepage}
  After the Parallelism TS 2 was published in 2018, data-parallel types (\simdT) have been implemented and used, and we are receiving feedback, this paper proposes to merge Section 9 of the Parallelism TS 2 into the IS working draft.

\section{Introduction}
\cite{P0214R9} introduced \simdT and related types and functions into the Parallelism TS 2 Section 9.
The TS was published in 2018.
An incomplete and non-conforming (because P0214 evolved) implementation existed for the whole time P0214 progressed through the committee.
Shortly after the GCC 9.1.0 release, a complete implementation of Section 9 of the TS was made available.

Note: This paper is not yet proposing the merge, but is aiming to start the process and raise awareness.
Later revisions will actually call for a merge.

\subsection{Related papers}
\begin{description}
  \item[\wglink{P0350}] Before publication of the TS, SG1 approved \cite{P0350R0} which did not progress in time in LEWG to make it into the TS.
    \wglink{P0350} is moving forward independently.
  \item[\wglink{P0918}] After publication of the TS, SG1 approved \cite{P0918R2} which adds \code{shuffle}, \code{interleave}, \code{sum_to}, \code{multiply_sum_to}, and \code{saturated_simd_cast}.
    \wglink{P0918} will move forward independently.
\end{description}
Both papers currently have no shipping vehicle and are basically blocked on this paper.

\section{Changes after TS feedback}
This section is mostly a stub.
\cite{P1915R0} (Expected Feedback from \code{simd} in the Parallelism TS 2) was just published and asks for specific feedback.
After gathering feedback, the relevant changes will be added to a new revision of this paper.

\subsection{Missing \code{simd_mask} generator constructor}
The \code{simd} generator constructor is very useful for initializing objects from scalars in a portable (different \code{size()}) fashion.
The need for a similar constructor for \code{simd_mask} is less frequent, but if only for consistency, there should be one.
Besides consistency, it is also useful, of course.
Consider a predicate function that is given without \code{simd} interface (e.g. from a library).
How do you construct a \code{simd_mask} from it?
With a generator constructor it is easy:
\medskip\begin{lstlisting}[style=Vc]
simd<T> f(simd<T> x, Predicate p) {
  const simd_mask<T> k([&](auto i) { return p(x[i]); });
  where(k, x) = 0;
  return x;
}
\end{lstlisting}
Without the generator constructor one has to write e.g.:
\medskip\begin{lstlisting}[style=Vc]
simd<T> f(simd<T> x, Predicate p) {
  simd_mask<T> k;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < simd<T>::size(); ++i) {
    k[i] = p(x[i]);
  }
  where(k, x) = 0;
  return x;
}
\end{lstlisting}
The latter solution makes it hard to initialize the \code{simd_mask} as \code{const}, is more verbose, is harder to optimize, and cannot use the sequencing properties the generator constructor allows.

Therefore add:
\begin{wgText}
\begin{itemdecl}
template<class G> simd_mask(G&& gen) noexcept;
\end{itemdecl}

\begin{itemdescr}
  \pnum\effects
  Constructs an object where the $i^\text{th}$ element is initialized to \tcode{gen(integral_constant<size_t, i>())}.

  \pnum\remarks
  This constructor shall not participate in overload resolution unless \tcode{static_cast<bool>(gen(integral_constant<size_t, i>()))} is well-formed \foralli.

  \pnum
  The calls to \tcode{gen} are unsequenced with respect to each other. Vectorization-unsafe standard library functions may not be invoked by \tcode{gen} (\ref{algorithms.parallel.exec}).
\end{itemdescr}
\end{wgText}

\subsection{Add missing casts for \code{simd_mask}}
The \code{simd_cast} and \code{static_simd_cast} overloads for \code{simd_mask} were forgotten for the TS.
Without those casts (and no casts via constructors) mixing different arithmetic types is painful.
There is no motivation for forbidding casts on \code{simd_mask}.

Therefore add the following overloads:
\begin{wgText}
\begin{codeblock}
  template<class T, class U, class Abi> @\seebelow@ simd_cast(const simd_mask<U, Abi>&) noexcept;
  template<class T, class U, class Abi> @\seebelow@ static_simd_cast(const simd_mask<U, Abi>&) noexcept;
\end{codeblock}
\end{wgText}
