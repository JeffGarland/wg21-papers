# vector-types-paper

This repository holds the LuaLaTeX sources for the “Data-Parallel Vector Types &amp; Operations” paper
to be submitted to the C++ committee. It incorporates the work presented in N4184, N4185, and N4395.
While the previous papers described the API as implemented originally in the Vc library, this paper focuses
on getting it ready for LEWG.
