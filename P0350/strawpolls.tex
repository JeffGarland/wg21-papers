\section{Straw Polls}
\subsection{SG1 at Oulu}
\wgPoll{Ship it to LEWG?}{6 & 6 & 2 & 0 & 0}

\subsection{LEWG at Albuquerque}
\wgPoll{Forward the paper to LWG?}{1 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 1}
\noindent$\rightarrow$ Paper needs a revision: LEWG wants a list of affected algorithms and an update to concept requirements.

\subsection{LEWG at Cologne 2019}
\wgPoll{Prefer expressing simd execution via policy tag (not newly named algorithms, \code{std::\MayBreak{}simd_transform}, etc).}
{4&9&3&0&0}

\wgUnanimous{What do we do with predicates?
(Roughly option 2 from the paper, be mindful of the amount of wording that is thrown out of conformance.)}

\wgPoll{Require that this goes first into \code{std::ranges} algorithms (which havenâ€™t been parallelized yet).}
{0&2&7&5&2}

\noindent Revise and come back.
