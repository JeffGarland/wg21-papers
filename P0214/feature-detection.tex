\section{Feature Detection Macros}\label{sec:feature-detection}

For the purposes of SD-6, feature detection initially will be provided through the shipping vehicle (TS) itself.
For a standalone feature detection macro, I recommend \code{__cpp_lib_simd}.
If LEWG decides to rename the \simd class template, the feature detection macro needs to be renamed accordingly.
