\pnum The member type \referencetype is an unspecified type acting as a reference to an element of a data-parallel type with the following properties:
\label{sec:reference type}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The type has a deleted default constructor, copy constructor, and copy assignment operator.

  \item Assignment, compound assignment, increment, and decrement operators shall not participate in overload resolution unless the \referencetype object is an rvalue and the corresponding operator for \valuetype is usable.

  \item Application of an assignment, compound assignment, increment, or decrement operator on a \referencetype object is applied to the referenced element.

  \item Objects of type \referencetype are implicitly convertible to \valuetype returning the value of the referenced element.

  \item If a binary operator is applied to an object of type \referencetype, the operator is only applied after converting the \referencetype object to \valuetype.

  \item Calls to \code{swap(\referencetype \&\&, \valuetype \&)} and \code{swap(\valuetype \&, \referencetype \&\&)} exchange the values referred to by the \referencetype object and the \valuetype reference.
  Calls to \code{swap(\referencetype \&\&, \referencetype \&\&)} exchange the values referred to by the \referencetype objects.
\end{itemize}
