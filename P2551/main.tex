\section{Introduction}
\cite{P1841R2} provides wording for numeric traits.
The last design paper was \cite{P0437R1} with additions from \cite{P1370R1}.
Most of the open questions were answered in LEWG already.
The question on \code{reciprocal_overflow_threshold} was deferred to let the authors of \cite{P1370R1} and this paper determine the original intent and its consequences.


\section{Remaining Design Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Decision already taken in LEWG.

  \item Decision already taken in LEWG.

  \item Decision already taken in LEWG.

  \item reciprocal_overflow_threshold yields a subnormal number for IEC559 types.
  How should this value change wrt. treat-denormals-as-zero?
  I.e. in a situation where the hardware treats subnormal operands as zero you get 1/0 -> inf, which does overflow.
  In which case it doesn't match the specification anymore (“The smallest positive value $x$ of type \type{T} such that \code{T(1)}$/x$ does not overflow”).
  This trait is specified by a behavior and as such may depend on processor state.
  As a compile-time constant this value must be independent from runtime behavior.
  But what is the correct value?
  See \url{https://godbolt.org/z/eWxdnTYf8} for a demonstration of the problem.

  Update after consultation with Mark and Damien (the P1370R1 authors):
  \begin{itemize}
  \item It would be possible to decouple the specification from runtime behavior by specifying behavior of constant expressions only;
    i.e. that \code{T(1)}$/x$ does not overflow \emph{in a constant expression}.
  \item P1370R1 presented an algorithm to determine the value and it does not yield the “\emph{smallest} positive value $x$ of type \type{T} such that \code{T(1)}$/x$ does not overflow”.
  \item The P1370R1 algorithm seems to ensure that the value is never subnormal.
    Thus, the specification should have been “The smallest positive \emph{normal} value $x$ of type \type{T} such that \code{T(1)}$/x$ does not overflow”
  \item If \code{reciprocal_overflow_threshold} is limited to normal values we're not sure who would use the \code{reciprocal_overflow_threshold} constant.
    It seems simpler and safer to remove the constant from P1841.
  \end{itemize}

  \item Decision already taken in LEWG.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Suggested Straw Polls}

\wgPoll{Remove \code{reciprocal_overflow_threshold} from P1841.}{&&&&}

\noindent If the above poll doesn't reach consensus:\\

\wgPoll{Specify behavior of \code{1 / reciprocal_overflow_threshold} only for constant expressions.}{&&&&}

\wgPoll{Require \code{reciprocal_overflow_threshold} to be a normal number.}{&&&&}
